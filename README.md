Mosel vim plugin
================

A compilation of usefull plugins for developing with
Mosel. The 'mosel.vba' vimball enables syntax highlighting and folding.
We also recommend two very usefull packages: SnipMate and Supertab which
can be used to add code snippet pasting and autocompletion.

Building the VIM ball

If you want to build the VimMosel vimball after you have done some modifications then simply source the VIM script makefile.vim. It will package up all files into vimmosel.vba and supertab.vmb. You will then have to manually save the vimmosel.vba and supertab.vmb files:
> so makefile.vim

Install Mosel-Vim

If you simply want to install the VimMosel plugins then you just have to download the vimmosel.vba file and then issue any of the following commands.

Simply enter the following command:
> vim -c 'so mosel.vba' -c 'q'

or load the file in vim and enter the following command:
> :so %

Simply enter the following command:
